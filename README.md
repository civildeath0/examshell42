# examshell42

This the examshell of school 42

## Dependencies

* Python 2 (likely already installed on your system)
* virtualenv

## Installation

Run `sudo ./install.sh`

## Removal

Just run `sudo ./uninstall.sh`

## Usage

Make sure that `/usr/local/bin` is in your path. All you need next is running `examshell` from a prompt.

## Known bugs / differences

* It does not work outside of the school network. This is not a restriction of this script, it is a restriction of the network infrastructure of 42.
* You may only run it in training mode. If you wonder why, I wonder why you would want to run it in real mode.
